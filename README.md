Install and Explore Selenium for automated testing.
REQUIREMENT Selenium WebDriver
Selenium is a popular open-source tool used for automated testing of web 
applications. Here are the steps to install and explore Selenium:
1. Install the Selenium WebDriver
You can install the Selenium WebDriver using the language-specific bindings. 
Here, we will use Python as an example:
pip install selenium
2. download the appropriate web driver executable
You need to download a web driver executable that corresponds to the browser 
you want to automate. Selenium supports a range of browsers, including Chrome, 
Firefox, Safari, and more. You can download the driver from the official website of 
the corresponding browser.
3. Create a Selenium test script
Create a new Python script to run your Selenium test. Here's an example of a 
simple script that opens a webpage in Chrome and closes the browser:
from selenium import webdriver
# Path to the chromedriver executable
driver_path = 'path/to/chromedriver'
# Initialize a new Chrome browser instance
driver = webdriver.Chrome(driver_path)
# Open a webpage
driver.get('https://www.google.com')
# Close the browser
driver.quit()
